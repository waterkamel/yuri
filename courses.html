      <p>Finishing school can be daunting. With the pressure of exams and the knowledge that everything you have ever known is coming to an end, it is not surprising that you will be feeling a little anxious or lost. <br>
        The key to relieving your fears is being prepared and excited for the future. Some of you will know, or will have known for sometime, exactly what your next step is and that is amazing! <br>
        However, for a lot of people, you are probably wading waist deep in a pool of potential post school options, trying to hang onto one, any one, just to stop you from drowning. <br>        
        For those of you who are still unsure about where your future lies, never fear. There are people almost twice your age who still do not know what they want to be when they grow up.</p>
      <h3 class="page-title"><b>Do you know</b></h3>
      <p>There are other lines of occupation/career you could go for apart from Medicine,Engineering,Accountancy and
        Law?</p>
